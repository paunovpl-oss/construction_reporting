# Copilot Instructions

## Product Goal
Build a **Construction Works Reporting App** for tracking project progress across defined construction stages.

Architecture and Tech Stack
Classical client-server app:

Front-end: JS app, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS
Back-end: Supabase 
Database: PostgreSQL
Authentication: Supabase Auth
Build tools: Vite, npm
API: Supabase REST API
Hosting: Netlify
Source code: GitHub
Modular Design
Use modular code structure, with separate files for different components, pages and features. Use ES6 modules to organize the code.

UI Guidelines
Use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Vanilla JS for the front-end.
Use Bootstrap components and utilities to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
Implement modern, responsive UI design, with semantic HTML.
Use a consistent color scheme and typography throughout the app.
Use appropriate icons, effects and visual cues to enhance usability.
Pages and Navigation
Split the app into multiple pages: login, registration, project list, dashboard, admin panel, etc.
Implement pages as reusable components (HTML, CSS and JS code).
Use routing to navigate between pages.
Use full URLs like: /, /login, /register, /projects, /projects/{id}/admin, etc.
Backend and Database
Use Supabase as the backend and database for the app.
Use PostgreSQL as the database, with tables for users, projects, items, etc.
Use Supabase Storage for file uploads (e.g. bill/invoice attachments, delivery notes attachments).
When changing the DB schema, always use migrations to keep track of changes.
After applying a migration in Supabase, keep a copy of the migration SQL file in the code.
Never edit existing migrations after they have been applied --> create a new migration for any changes to the DB schema.
Authentication and Authorization
Use Supabase Auth for user authentication and authorization.
Implement RLS policies to restrict access to data based on user roles and permissions.
Implement user roles with a separate DB table user_roles + enum roles (e.g. admin, user).
